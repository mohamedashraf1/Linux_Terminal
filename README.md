# Linux_Terminal

An operating system interfaces with a user through a Command Line Interpreter (CLI). A CLI is a software module capable of interpreting textual commands coming either from the user’s keyboard or from a script file. A CLI is often referred to as a shell.

the command used in this project is :

1- clear : This command can be called to clear the current terminal screen and it can be redirected to clear the screen of some other terminal.

2- cd : This command changes the current directory to another one.

3- ls : These programs list each given file or directory name. Directory contents are sorted alphabetically. For ls, files are by default listed in columns, sorted vertically, if the standard output is a terminal; otherwise, they are listed one per line.

4- cp : If the last argument names an existing directory, cp copies each other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it copies the first onto the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given. By default, it does not copy directories.

5- mv : If the last argument names an existing directory, mv moves each other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it moves the first onto the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given. It can move only regular files across file systems. If a destination file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the –f or --force option is not given, mv prompts the user for whether to overwrite the file. If the response does not begin with y or Y, the file is skipped.

6- rm : rm removes each specified file. By default, it does not remove directories. If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the -f or --force option is not given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file. If the response does not begin with y or Y, the file is skipped.

7- mkdir : mkdir creates a directory with each given name. By default, the mode of created directories is 0777 minus the bits set in the umask.

8- rmdir : rmdir removes each given empty directory. If any nonoption argument does not refer to an existing empty directory, it is an error.

9- cat : Concatenate files and print on the standard output.

10- more : Let us display and scroll down the output in one direction only. You can scroll page by page or line by line.

11- pwd : Display current user directory.

12- args : list all parameters on the command line, numbers or strings for specific command. (eg. “args cp” should print “arg1: SourcePath, arg2: DestinationPath”).

13- date : output current system date and time.

14- help : list all user commands and the syntax of their arguments.
